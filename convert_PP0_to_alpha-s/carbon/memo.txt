
CB = Carbon Black (NGCB = Non-Graphitized Carbon Black)
GCB = Graphitized Carbon Black

Q. How to convert from P/P0 to alpha-s plot ?
A. Linear approximation is performed between two points near the actual P/P0.

Q. How to calculate "slope" in alpha-s plot ?
A. The "slope" in the alpha-s plot is obtained by connecting the origin and the valley between the two "swings" with a straight line. As an aside, in a carbon system using N2 gas, alpha-s = 0.5 corresponds to single-layer adsorption.

Q. Should I use CB (NGCB) or GCB ? 
A. Local crystallinity in the pores may be improved in samples treated with activated carbon at a high temperature of 1000 degrees or higher, so it is necessary to consider using GCB instead of CB.

  Relative Analyte Size: >C20
  Analyte size relative to n-Alkanes. Consider all atoms, not just Carbon. For example, even  though 1,2-Dichloroethane is a C2, the two Chlorine atoms give it a relative size between  C4 and C5.
